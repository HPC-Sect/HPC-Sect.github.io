<p>Hi,</p>

<p>HPC-Sect is a group openly devoted to promotion of HPC education and applying the ideas of parallelism in solving interesting problems in context of different architectures</p>

<p>HPC itself is study of methods, which focus on problem soving in faster and efficient way. But community of HPC is still young, and our motto is to create baby steps so that people can understand a little about HPC and its potentials. </p>
