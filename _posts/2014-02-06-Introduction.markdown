It was a lot of hassle, to select a good logo, or site template for that matter, but in
the end, **HPC Sect** is on. Basically it is a group, that we started at IIIT Hyderabad,
to make basic ideas of HPC availiable to larger community of students. 

A good logo is what, any group needs. After a little search, this **Octcat**, with parallel
mind seemed a good idea. Our goal for this organisation is to study computational problems, and
formulate them in context of modern architectures.
